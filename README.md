# Worst Idea Today
This is a simple web application build with Meteor to list and rank the hilariously bad ideas we come up with everyday.
This was thought of in [Startup House](http://startuphouse.com/) on our first couple of days in San Francisco on the maiden [Startup Catalyst](http://startupcatalyst.com.au) trip.

In the words of Kelsey:
> That's a terrible idea you guys. You need a website to store all your dumb ideas.
